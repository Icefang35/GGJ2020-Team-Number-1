# Step-Dad Simulator
Step-Dad Simulator is a game made for Global Game Jam 2020 with the theme "repair." The idea of the game is you are watching your step-son, Spork, while your wife is out of town, but Spork is a major clutz and will break everything in the house if you let him. Your goal is to last as long as you can, trying to keep up with him, and fixing everything he breaks. This game was developed in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2020 using the Unity engine.
